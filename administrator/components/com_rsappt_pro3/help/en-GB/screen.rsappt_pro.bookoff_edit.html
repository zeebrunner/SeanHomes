<h1>Book-Off  Edit</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>You can Book-Off a full day or a range of hours within a day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Edit Area</h3>
<p><strong>Resource:</strong> In edit mode this will show the name of the resource owning this book-off record. In Add New mode,  you select the specific resource name. </p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Date for the Book-Off, use the popup calendar to choose a date. </p>
<p> If you are entering a <strong>NEW</strong> book off, there will be 2 date boxes. You can enter a range of dates and the system will create <strong>multiple book-off days*</strong>. This would be used to book-off a week at one time. The maximum book-offs that can be made at one time is 20.</p>
<p>*Note: This makes multiple <em>individual</em> book-offs. To remove or change any or all you will need to edit/delete them individually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Full Day:</strong> Yes = this book-off will block all time slots for the entire day. If <strong>Full Day = No</strong>, use the start/end times to determine the book-off start and ending times. These times are ignored if you set Full Day = Yes.<br />
You <strong>must</strong> set the book off range to match time slot boundaries. <strong><em>For example if you  have a time slot that runs from 10:00-11:00 do not start you book-off at  10:30</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Start/End:</strong> If 'Full Day' is No, these are the hours that will be booked off.</p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>Text entered here will appear in the book-off block on the booking screen. You can leave it blank or enter a reason for the book-off if you want the customer to know why there are no slots available.</p>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> Only Book-Offs with Published set to <strong>Yes</strong> will effect the booking screens.</p>
