<h1>Resource Categories</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The first thing to point out is that Categories are OPTIONAL - you do not need to set up any categories unless you feel they would help or be useful to you.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Category?</strong></p>
<p>A category is an arbitrarily define entity that a resource can belong, or be assigned to. Categories sit above resources in the structure hierarchy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why use Categories?</strong></p>
<p>Two reasons mainly;</p>
<ol>
  <li>You have too many resources to fit in the resource drop down list. With categories you can break the resources list into groups (or categories). The user first picks the category, then sees a smaller list of resources that you have assigned to the category.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Physical locations. If you have offices in two cities you can set up two categories and assign the resources in the appropriate category.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Things to know about Categories.</strong></p>
<p>There is a one to one relation between resource an category, you can only assign a resource to one category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Resource Category</strong> -&gt; Resource -&gt; Resource Service</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Categories defined: Calgary Office, Edmonton Office</p>
<p>Resources:<br />
Dr Foo - assigned Calgary Office<br />
Dr Bar - assigned Edmonton Office<br />
Mr Smith - assigned  Edmonton Office<br />
Mr Jones - assigned Calgary Office</p>

<p><img src="../images/cat2.jpg" border="1"  /></p>
<p><img src="../images/cat3.jpg" border="1"  /></p>
<p>What if Dr Foo works out of both offices?</p>
<p>He would no doubt <strong>not</strong> be in both locations at the same time. Make two resources called Dr Foo and assign one to each office. Each 'Dr Foo' will need it's own available dates and times. </p>
<p>To DISABLE the use of Resource Categories, do not create any!</p>
<p>  If ANY Resource Categories are published, that will enable the use of  Resource Categories on the booking screen. When enabled, ALL resources  must be assigned to some category or they will not be displayed on the  booking screen.</p>
