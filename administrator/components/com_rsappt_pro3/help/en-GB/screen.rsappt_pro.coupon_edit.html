<h1>Coupon Edit</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The coupon system allows you to create coupon codes, assign discount levels and expiry dates to them and give them to customers. With the coupon system enabled (done in the Configure/PayPal screen) the booking screen will show a coupon entry box. When the customer enters a code, it is validated and the discount applied to the total cost. </p>
<p>Coupons are only meaningful when PayPal is enabled.</p>

<p>If the PayPal total after discount is $0, no trip to PayPal is made and the booking is placed immediately.</p>
