<h2><hr />
<a name="general" id="general"></a>General Settings tab</h2>
<p><strong>Additional Fee:</strong> You can optionally add an additional fee to the PayPal/AuthNet transaction. This can be either a fixed fee or percentage for the total. An example may be a processing fee you wish to charge.</p>
<p><strong>Enable Coupons</strong>: Set to yes if you wish to enable the coupon system and show a coupon entry box on the booking screens.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Pay Booking Button</strong>: ABPro always shows a submit button when PayPal and AuthNet are disabled. <br />
  <strong><em>	No</em></strong> = Do not show a non-pay booking button when either PayPal or AuthNet are enabled.(non-pay bookings are not allowed)<br />
  <strong><em>Yes</em></strong> = Still show a non-pay booking button when PayPal OR AuthNet are enabled. (non-pay bookings are optional)<br />
  <strong><em>Display Only</em></strong> = Display costs even when PayPal or AuthNet are both disabled. All bookings go through. This would be used if you are collecting payment outside of ABPro but still wish to show the customer booking charges. <br />
<strong><em>Display &amp; Block</em></strong> = Same as Display Only but blocks booking if amount due &gt; 0.00. This is used with the ABPro User Credit system so that a booking can be made only if the user has enough credit.</p>
<p><strong>Purge Stale Bookings</strong>: This is used to free timeslots when customer bails out of PayPal/AuthNet without paying. The stale booking will have its status set to `timeout`. Use with caution as this will cause PayPal eChecks to fail as they can take several days to clear.</p>

<h2><a name="PayPal" id="PayPal"></a>PayPal tab</h2>
<p>With PayPal enabled, the booking screen will show the calculated cost at hours x rate, or flat rate depending on how you set it up. </p>
<p>The other main difference when enabling PayPal, is that a new request will get inserted with a status of 'pending' rather than 'new'. The user is sent to PayPal to make their payment. They are sent back to your site. In a separate thread, PayPal processes the payment and sends an IPN (Instant Payment Notification) message to your site. This IPN is really not 'instant' and your customer may have been returned to your site before the IPN arrives. In this case the in-progress message is shown to the customer. When PayPal completes the payment processing, they send the customer an email and send your site an IPN message. When the customer comes back to your site, the return page checks to see if the transaction has completed. If it has it displays the confirmation message, if not it displays the in-progress message. These messages are set in the 'Messages' tab. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a booking is made with status 'Pending', the timeslot is locked just as if it were accepted. The display GAD display will show a dashed border so you can see what timeslots are 'Pending'. Normally a slot should only be 'Pending' for a few minute (seconds?) while PayPal is processing the payment. If the user aborts out of PayPal without paying, the slot will stay 'Pending' (and locked) until admin deletes it or it is switched to 'timeout' by the stale bookings setting.</p>
