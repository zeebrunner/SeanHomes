<h1>Rate Overrides</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Rate Overrides is an <b>optional</b> feature allowing you to define special rates charged based on what Joomla Group a customer is assigned to. These overrides can be applied to resource(s), service(s), extra(s) or seat type(s).</p>
<p>Initial rate setup is done in the respective entity's setup screen. For example, the resource rate is set in the resource setup screen. </p>
<p>Rates set here <i>override</i> those rates so you can do things like, offer a <i>different</i> rate for registered users or users assigned to specific Joomla Groups.</p>
<p>Before setting up an override rate, you should be aware of ABPro's order of preference in different types of rates.</p>
<p><u>Order of Precedence</u><br />
  Service rate has precedence over resource rate. If you define both, the service rate is used.<br />
  Seat price has precedence over both resource and service rates.<br />
  <br />
  The Override rates <strong>do not</strong> compromise this order of precedence.<br />
For example, if you define an override rate for a Resource but you have a Service rate, the Service rate it used.</p>
