<h1>Appointments</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When a user submits a booking request via the Appointment Booking component's entry screen, a 'Appointment Request' is created.</p>
<p> This screen shows all requests. The term 'request' is a hold over from the programs early days. An accepted Appointment booking is still a booking 'request'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Toolbar Icons</h2>


<p><strong>Remove:</strong> Deletes one or more booking requests.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Opens the Appointments Edit screen to allow you to view and modify the request.</p>
<p><strong>Reminders</strong>: You can send reminder messages to users. (message text defined in the configure screen). Use the Date filter to choose a date then select bookings to receive reminders. Reminders will only be sent to bookings in the future, that are in 'Accepted' status.</p>
<p><strong>Export/CSV:</strong> Exports request details for one or more Appointments to a csv file. The csv file can be read into Excel for reporting purposes.</p>
