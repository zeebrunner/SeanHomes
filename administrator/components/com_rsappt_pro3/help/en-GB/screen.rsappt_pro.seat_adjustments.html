<h1>Seat Adjustments</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Seat Adjustments is an <b>optional</b> feature allowing you to define adjustments to a resource's Max Seats setting. The adjustment can be applied based on day of the week, time of day, or day and time.</p>
<p>Initial Max Seats setting is done in the resource setup screen. </p>
<p>There are 3 ways to apply adjustments:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Day Only</strong>: The adjustment will be applied to all timeslots in the selected day of the week, regardless of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Time Only</strong>: The adjustment will be applied to all timeslots in the selected time range, every day of the week.</li>
  <li><strong>Day and Time</strong>: The adjustment will be applied on the selected day(s) of the week, for timeslots in the specified time range.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Timeslots that begin or end in an adjustment area will have the adjustment applied. <br />
For example, if an adjustment is set as 4:00-6:00, a slot that runs from 3:00 to 4:30 will have the adjustment applied.</p>
