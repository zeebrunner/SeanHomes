<h1>Seat Type Edit</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The first thing to point out is that <strong>Seats per Booking are OPTIONAL</strong> - you do not need to set up any seat types unless you plan to offer multiple seats per booking.</p>
<p>This would be used for tours or classes but not for individual appointments.</p>
<p>Seats/Booking can be used in conjunction with PayPal and the appropriate totals will be calculated, or it can be used merely to tell you how many customer of various type will be booking. ie: if you need to know how many adults vs children.</p>
<p>To <strong>disable</strong> the seats/booking capability, <strong>do not publish any seats types</strong>.</p>

<h3>Edit Area</h3>
<p><strong>Seat Type:</strong> Seat Type name. This will become the booking screen label for the seat type.</p>
<p><strong>Tool Tip:</strong> This text will appear when the customer hovers over the dropdown list for this seat type. </p>
<p><strong>Seat Cost:</strong> This will be the amount charged <strong>per seat</strong> of this type. <br />
Exception; in the case of 'group pricing' the price is charged <strong>per booking</strong> regardless of how many seats. </p>
<p><strong>Help Text:</strong> This text appears to the right of the dropdown list where the user selects how many seats of this type they want.<strong> Example:</strong> <em>Child (12 years or under)</em></p>
<p> <strong>Group Seat Type:</strong> If set to Yes, this seat type is a 'group seat' and the charge will be  fixed regardless of how many seats are being booked (to max group size). Example: Family price, <em>$x</em> for a family of 5.</p>
<p><strong>Max Group Size: </strong>Maximum number in the group price, example: Family rate max may be 5.  This will allow a family of up to 5 seats for the fixed Family rate.  This is also used as the max number of seats in the dropdown list for  this seat type. </p>
<p><strong>Resources: </strong>You can assign this  seat type  to one or more resources. If NOT assigned, it will be shown for ALL. Select one or more resources that this  seat type applies to. If you wish  this  seat type to be available for ALL resources, do not select any.</p>
<p><strong>Order:</strong> This determines the order this Category will appear in the Category drop down list on the Appointment Booking screen.</p>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> Only categories with Published set to <strong>Yes</strong> will appear in the drop down list on the Appointment Booking screen.</p>
