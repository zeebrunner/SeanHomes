<h1>Seat Types</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The first thing to point out is that <strong>Seats per Booking are OPTIONAL</strong> - you do not need to set up any seat types unless you plan to offer multiple seats per booking.</p>
<p>This would be used for tours or classes but not for individual appointments.</p>
<p>Seats/Booking can be used in conjunction with PayPal and the appropriate totals will be calculated, or it can be used merely to tell you how many customer of various type will be booking. ie: if you need to know how many adults vs children.</p>
<p>To <strong>disable</strong> the seats/booking capability, <strong>do not publish any seats types</strong>.</p>
