<h1>Resource Services</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The first thing to point out is that Services are OPTIONAL - you do not need to set up any services unless you feel they would help or be useful to you.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Service?</strong></p>
<p>A Service is an arbitrarily define entity that can be associated with resource. Services sit below resources in the structure hierarchy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why use Services?</strong></p>
<p>If your resource can be booked to perform multiple tasks. Creating services for a resource allows your user to choose the resource AND what service is to be performed. An example would be a staff member in a Spa, she can be booked to do various services, massage, manicure, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Things to know about Services.</strong></p>
<p>You can create as many services as you wish for a resource. A service is specific to a resource but you can copy services to other resources. For example, if your Spa has three staff and all do massage, you can copy the 'massage' service to the other staff members (resources).</p>
<p>Services and services can be used together, they have no real relation to one another.</p>
<p>The service selected by the user will appear in the booking detail.</p>
