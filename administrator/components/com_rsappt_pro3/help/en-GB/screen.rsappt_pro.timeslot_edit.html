<h1>Time Slot Edit</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A Time Slot is a block of time in the day that you wish to allow visitors to book an appointment. 
A day can have as many time slots as you like. </p>
<p>The Appointment Booking component stores a booking with a start and end date and time. 
  The time slot just allows you to specify a fixed start/end that is easy for your visitor to choose.</p>
<p class="style1">Note: Changing a time slot has no effect on previously created bookings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Toolbar Icons</h3>


<p><strong>Cancel:</strong> Abort changes and return to the previous screen.</p>
<p>
<strong>Save:</strong> Save changes and return to the previous screen.</p>
<p><strong>Help:</strong> Opens this help screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Edit Area</h3>
<p><strong>Resource:</strong> Select either 'Global' or a specific resource name. Resources with their 'time slots' set to 'Global' will not appear in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Day:</strong> Choose the day you want this time slot to apply to.</p>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Select the <strong>start time</strong> for this time slot.</p>
<p><strong>End:</strong> Select the <strong>end time</strong> for this time slot. Ensure the end time is after the start time.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The description is shown on the timeslot on the GAD booking screen. If left blank, no description is shown, the green checkmark image is displayed. <br />
  There is not much room so keep it brief.
      This would <strong>only be used</strong> if you need to provide <strong>special information</strong> about the timeslot, for example 'Morning Session'. </p>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> Only time slots with Published set to <strong>Yes</strong> will appear in the dropdown list on the Resource Booking screen</p>
<p><br />
        Notes: 
<ul>
  <li>Changes to time slots will have NO EFFECT on existing bookings.</li>
  <li> When checking for duplicate bookings, ABPro uses (starttime + 1 second) to (endtime -1 second) so adjacent slots can be set with<strong> common end points</strong><br />
    Example: 9:00-<strong>9:15</strong> next slot can be <strong>9:15</strong>-9:20.</li>
  <li>Currently no support for time slots going past midnight.</li>
</ul>
