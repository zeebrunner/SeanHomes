<h1>Time Slot Setup</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A Time Slot is a block of time in the day that you wish to allow visitors to book. 
A day can have as many time slots as you like. </p>
<p>The Appointment Booking component stores a booking with a start and end date and time. 
  The time slot just allows you to specify a fixed start/end that is easy for your visitor to choose.</p>
<p class="style1">Note: Changing a time slot has no effect on previously created bookings.</p>
